# Backend

This is a API running on NodeJS. The API is built to establish a connection between our App and BlockChain Network.
With the help of ####Web3Js , we connect to the deployed Smartcontracts. 
We tried to implement a Microservices Architecture, where the Different Parts of the App are Deployed seperately and connected via the API only.

Steps to run the Code Locally.
1. Make sure your system has NodeJS installed
2. Clone the Repo
3. In the Folder, perform the Command `npm i` to install all the Dependencies
4. To start the server command `nodemon app.js`
5. The Server starts at port: 8080
